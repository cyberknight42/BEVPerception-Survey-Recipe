## <div id='intro'>BEV-Toolbox</div>

This is an open source BEV 3D object detection toolbox based on PyTorch, associated with the survey paper "[Delving into the Devils of Bird‚Äôs-eye-view Perception: A Review, Evaluation and Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05324)". This toolbox provides useful recipe for BEV camera-based 3D object detection, including solid data augmentation strategies, efficient BEV encoder design, perception heads and loss function family, useful test-time augmentation and ensemble policy, and so on. We hope this toolbox can not only be a good starting point for new beginners but also help current researchers in the BEV perception community.

### Major Features

* **Support Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) for camera-only detection** <br> We provide a suitable playground for new-beginners in this area, including hands-on tutorial and small-scale dataset (1/5 WOD in kitti format) to validate idea.
* **Integration with bag of tricks** <br> All these tricks are verifed in the Waymo Open Challenge and help us achieve 1st in the camera-based detection track eventually.

## <div id='update'>What's New</div>

v0 was released in x/x/2022.
* Support Waymo dataset
* Integrate bag of tricks
* Provide checkpoint and performance for some tricks

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.

## <div id='overview'>Overview of BEV Perception</div>

![](figs/general_overview.jpg)
The general picture of BEV perception at a glance, where consists of three sub-parts based on the input modality. BEV perception is a general task built on top of a series of fundamental tasks. For better completeness of the whole perception algorithms in autonomous driving, we list other topics as well.

## <div id='tutorial'>Getting Started</div>

### For beginners
We provide a pipeline for beginners to run a baseline experiment on Waymo 1/5 training data and wrote detailed instruction for the installation of environment, preparation of data and usage of code.

#### 1. Installation
Please refer to [instatllation.md](docs/installation.md) for installation of environment.

#### 2. Data Preparation

Please refer to [data_preparation.md](docs/data_preparation.md) for preparation of dataset and pretrained model.

#### 3. Usage
Please refer to [usage.md](docs/usage.md) for commands of training and evaluation.

### For expert

We provide bag of tricks to boost the performance of the baseline below implemented by our toolbox.

## <div id='tricks'>Bag of Tricks</div>
We provide an overview of the bag of tricks as the model zoo, which can be grouped as four types -- data augmentation, design of BEV encoder, loss family and different 3D detection head and post-process policy. Please click the link of each trick for more details. We also offer their corresponding configs and performance in the table below for the convenience of users.
